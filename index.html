About me
I'm a 30 year-old graduate student on the West Coast. I'm working toward certification as a Linux sysadmin, a change from my academic path.
This page is practice for a personal webpage  where I intend to put up my thoughts and opinions on the tech and computer industry today, historically, and in the future.
